# mini-commerce
This is the Mini Commerce Platform development. It includes clear service boundaries (Order, Inventory, Payment), asynchronous eventing, perâ€‘service databases, secure APIs, observability, automated testing, and Kubernetes-based deployment. The UI is simple: place a new order and check the status.
